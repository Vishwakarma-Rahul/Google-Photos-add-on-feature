# Google-Photos-add-on-feature
This add-on feature will allow the user to select specific people to be seen in an image together and shows the images.

Google Photos currently has features which involves face recognition and tagging people based on that. 
When different ocassions arise like birthdays of friends or some event where you want a few selected people to be in the picture. Then there is no feature that can enable it.
We found a interesting add-on to the current face tagging feature using which the user can select all the people who he/she wants to see in the photo together. 
Our add-on will show all such images which has all the selected people in it.

We have created a sample case where there are five people tags and they have images in those directories just the way the album section of Google Photos app works. The code requests for the people whom you want together in a picture. On submitting the request the response gives all such images that satisfies the condition.

We would love to hear from Google and the Google Photos team about this and would love to improvise on it with assistance.
